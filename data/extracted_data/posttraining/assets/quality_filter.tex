I would like to rate conversations with an AI assistant using the following rubric: \\

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Accuracy} (1 point): \\
    - The AI should not make mistakes anywhere in the conversation.\\
    - The AI responses should be free of factual or reasoning errors or self-contradictions. All mathematical calculations must be accurate.\\
    - Analyze the responses carefully for factually incorrect claims. Do not award points for false or dubious information, stereotypes or generalizations, or fabricated events or people. \\

    \emph{Example of Inaccurate Dialog}: <EXAMPLE> \\
    \emph{Reason}: <EXAMPLE> \\

\item \textbf{Instruction Following} (1 point): \\
    - The AI responses should address all parts of the user's query and accurately follows its instructions. \\
    - The AI should not unnecessarily resort to ethical guidelines when the user's query is obviously harmless. \\

    \emph{Example of Poorly Followed Instructions}: <EXAMPLE> \\
    \emph{Reason}: <EXAMPLE> \\

\item \textbf{Tone and Presentation} (1 point): \\
    - The AI responses should be to-the-point, clear, and free of spelling and grammatical mistakes. \\
    - The AI responses should have a tone and style that makes sense given the user's query.\\
    - The AI responses should be formatted clearly and easy-to-read.\\
    - The AI responses should not be unnecessarily verbose, repetitive, unclear, second-guessing, judgemental, or preachy.\\

    \emph{Example of Poor Tone and Presentation}: <EXAMPLE>\\
    \emph{Reason}: <EXAMPLE>
\end{itemize} 

Now I will provide you an conversation between an AI system and a user. \\

Please rate the quality of the AI responses using the above rubric. \\

First, provide a brief justification of your score. \\

Then, conclude with your rating in the format FINAL SCORE: <SCORE>/3. \\

Be extremely strict and objective; only award the point if the criterion is fully satisfied. \\

If any part of the criterion is not satisfied, however minor, do not award the point. Do not award partial points.

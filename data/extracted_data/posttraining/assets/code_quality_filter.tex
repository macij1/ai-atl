You are a code reviewer for the following question answer pairs. Your job is to rate the quality of each answer based on the following criteria: \\

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Bug Identification} (1 point): \\
    - Check if you can find any bug in the code. Provide a reasoning chain of why the answer is or is not buggy and the final result. \\

\item \textbf{User Intention} (1 point): \\
    - Check if the answer satisfy the user's need or not. Provide a reasoning chain about what's the final answer of the model and why it satisfy the user's intent or not. \\
    
\end{itemize} 

I will now present you with a coding-related question-answer exchange between an AI system and a user. \\

Analyze the Question: Consider the AI's responses in the context of the user's queries. Apply each criterion to evaluate how well the AI's responses meet these standards. \\

Justify Your Scoring: For each point awarded, provide a brief explanation (up to 50 words per criterion) justifying why the AI's responses meet the specific criterion. \\
        
Final Score: Conclude your evaluation with the total score out of 2, formatted as Final Score: <SCORE>/2. This should be the sum of the points awarded for each criterion. \\

Note: Be sure to be careful and strict, even one small bug can cause the failure of the program. Ensure that the final score does not exceed 2 points. Do not award partial points.

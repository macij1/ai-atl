The development of Llama 3 builds on a large body of prior work studying foundation models for language, images, videos, and speech.
A comprehensive overview of that work is outside the scope of this paper; we refer the reader to \citet{bordes2024vlm,madan2024foundation,LLMSurvey} for such overviews.
Below, we briefly outline seminal works that directly influenced the development of Llama 3.

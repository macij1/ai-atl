\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this systematic study of analysis methods for neural models of
spoken language we offered some suggestions on best practices in this
endeavor. Nevertheless our work is only a first step, and several
limitations remain. The main challenge is that it is often difficult
to completely control for the many factors of variation in the target
models, due to the fact that a particular objective function, or even
a dataset, may require relatively important architectural
modifications. In future we will sample target models with a larger
number of plausible combinations of factors. Likewise, a choice of an
analytical method may often entail changes in other aspects of the
analysis: for example, unlike a global diagnostic classifier, global
RSA captures the sequential order of phonemes.  In future work we hope
to further disentangle these differences.

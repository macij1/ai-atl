\section{Pre-Training}
\label{section:pretraining}

Language model pre-training involves: \textbf{(1)} the curation and filtering of a large-scale training corpus, \textbf{(2)} the development of a model architecture and corresponding scaling laws for determining model size, \textbf{(3)} the development of techniques for efficient pre-training at large scale, and \textbf{(4)} the development of a pre-training recipe. We present each of these components separately below.
